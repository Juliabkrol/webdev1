            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Barbie’s official birthday is March 9, 1959—the day she was officially introduced to the world. Handler always saw Barbie as a reflection of the times, with the first doll mimicking the glamour of 1950s stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe. In its first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold. The first Barbie doll sold for $3.00, but a mint condition #1 doll can fetch more than $25,000 today.Over the span of her existence, Barbie has had more than 200 careers. She broke the plastic ceiling when she went to the moon in 1965, four years before Neil Armstrong. Since then, she has been everything from a doctor to a paleontologist to a rock star to a computer engineer.</p>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>These days, Barbie's getting most of her love outside the U.S.

                Domestic sales of the classic fashion doll plunged 21 percent in the first quarter, Mattel Inc. said Monday in its earnings report.
                
                The drop followed four consecutive quarters in which Mattel saw U.S. demand increase for its flagship brand.
                
                Outside the U.S., Barbie's popularity kept surging, offsetting the domestic decline and translating into 2 percent growth in worldwide sales for the brand in the most recent quarter, Mattel said.</p>

            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
            <p>Though Ryan designed Barbie, the concept came from Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Handler was traveling through Europe with her kids when she came across the Germany-born Bild Lilli doll, who was anything but kid-friendly: Lilli was a high-class call girl who began her life as a comic and was sold in smoke shops, adult toy stores, and other not-kid-friendly places. But Handler, who had mentioned the idea of an adult doll to her Mattel exec husband before, liked what she saw. Though her husband, Elliot, had initially balked at the idea, the Lilli dolls sold him on the concept. Though Bild Lilli's manufacturer initially sued Mattel for patent infringement, the case was eventually dismissed and Mattel officially bought the rights to the doll for $21,600.</p>
